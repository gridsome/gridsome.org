** Day 1

*** 1. Using the manual to find emacs configuration convention

	1. Keybings is =Ctrl h ?=	for further options

	2. Keybings is =Ctrl h r=	for reading the manual

	{{<highlight emacs-lisp>}}
	#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
	(info-manual ARG)
	;; C-h r runs the command info-manual (found in global-map), which is an
	;; interactive Lisp function in ‘info+.el’.
	;;
	;; It is bound to C-h r, <f1> r, <help> r, <menu-bar> <help-menu> <emacs-manual>.
	;;
	;;
	;; Display a manual in Info mode - by default, the Emacs manual.
	;; With a prefix arg, prompt for the manual name.
	;; With a numeric prefix arg, only currently visited manuals are
	;; candidates.
	#+end_src
	{{</highlight>}}

	3. Navigating to =emacs-lisp Intro= section

	4. Find the =16.3= chapter =Beginning a dotemacs File=

*** 2. Beginning a dotemacs file

	{{<highlight emacs-lisp>}}
	#+begin_src emacs-lisp
			 ;;;; The Help Key
			 ; Control-h is the help key;
			 ; after typing control-h, type a letter to
			 ; indicate the subject about which you want help.
			 ; For an explanation of the help facility,
			 ; type control-h two times in a row.
			 ; To find out about any mode, type control-h m
			 ; while in that mode.  For example, to find out
			 ; about mail mode, enter mail mode and then type
			 ; control-h m.
	#+end_src
	{{</highlight>}}

*** 3. Load Path

	If you load many extensions, as I do, then instead of specifying the
	exact location of the extension file, as shown above, you can specify
	that directory as part of Emacs’s ‘load-path’.  Then, when Emacs loads a
	file, it will search that directory as well as its default list of
	directories.  (The default list is specified in ‘paths.h’ when Emacs is
	built.)

		 The following command adds your ‘~/emacs’ directory to the existing
	load path:

	{{<highlight emacs-lisp>}}
	#+srcname: name
	#+begin_src emacs-lisp
			 ;;; Emacs Load Path
			 (setq load-path (cons "~/emacs" load-path))
	#+end_src
	{{</highlight>}}

*** 4. Load file

	 You can use a ‘load’ command to evaluate a complete file and thereby
	install all the functions and variables in the file into Emacs.  For
	example:

	{{<highlight emacs-lisp>}}
	#+srcname: load-file
	#+begin_src emacs-lisp
			 (load "~/emacs/slowsplit")
	#+end_src
	{{</highlight>}}

*** 5. Keybindings

	Emacs uses “keymaps” to record which keys call which commands.  When you
	use ‘global-set-key’ to set the keybinding for a single command in all
	parts of Emacs, you are specifying the keybinding in
	‘current-global-map’.

	{{<highlight emacs-lisp>}}
	#+srcname: keybindings
	#+begin_src emacs-lisp
			 (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'buffer-menu)
			 (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-c\C-cg" 'texinfo-insert-@group)
	#+end_src
	{{</highlight>}}

	To be continued...
