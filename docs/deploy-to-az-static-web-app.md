## View the website

When you create an Azure Static Web App, Azure resources are provisined to make up your app. Also a GitHub Action workflow is created and commited to your repository. This workflow builds and publishes your application.

Before you can navigate to your new static site, the deployment build must first finish running.

The Static Web Apps overview window displays a series of links that help you interact with your web app.

![Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/media/getting-started/overview-window.png "Overview")

1. The banner at the top of Overview takes you  to the GitHub Actions running against your repository. Once you verify the deployment is complete, you can navigate using the generated URL.
2. You can click on the *URL* link to open your website.
