# Deploy to Google Cloud Platform

## Prerequisites

1. Create a project op Google Cloud Platform
2. Have access to DNS record of your domain

You can host a static website on a Google Cloud Storage bucket for a domain you own.

The downside to this is that you can only use HTTP.
Please follow this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) for a HTTP only website

The HTTPS configuration is a bit more complex.

## Use a Cloud Storage bucket as a load balancer backend

1. Configure a Cloud Storage bucket
2. Configure a load balancing service
3. Create an external address

Please follow the steps in the well documented Google [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/adding-a-backend-bucket-to-content-based-load-balancing)

### Set main and error page for bucket

```shell
gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://your-bucket-name
```

## Google cloud build

### Setup Google Source Repositories

[Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/)

### Add Build trigger

Create a new [trigger](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers)

Add a `cloudbuild.yaml` to the root of the project containing:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['install']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['run' , 'build']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
    args: ["-m", "rsync", "-r", "-c", "-d", "./dist", "gs://bucket-name"]
```

Last build step is to push static files to your bucket.

### Link DNS record to reserved external Google IP

You must link these to resolve your domain to our external Google IP address.
This can be done in your DNS service
