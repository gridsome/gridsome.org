### Prerequisites
You should have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and how to use the [Terminal](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/using-the-terminal/). Knowing how [Vue Single File components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) & [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) works is a plus, but not required. Gridsome is a great way to learn both.

Gridsome requires **Node.js** and recommends **Yarn**. [How to setup](/docs/prerequisites)


### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool

Using yarn:  
`yarn global add @gridsome/cli`

Using npm:  
`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project </li>
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### 3. Next steps

1. Create `.vue` components in the `/pages` directory to create page routes.
2. Use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `/dist` folder
