# Introduction

> Gridsome is a Vue.js powered [Jamstack](/docs/jamstack) framework for building static generated websites & apps that are [fast by default](/docs/fast-by-default/) ðŸš€.

## Why Gridsome?

- **Vue.js for frontend** - The simplest & most approachable frontend framework.
- **Data sourcing** - Use any Headless CMSs, APIs or Markdown-files for data.
- **Local development with hot-reloading** - See code changes in real-time.
- **File-based page routing** - Any `Name.vue` file in `src/pages` is a static route.
- **Dynamic routing** - Any `[param].vue` file in `src/pages` is a dynamic route.
- **Static file generation** - Deploy securely to any CDN or static web host.
- **GraphQL data layer** - Simpler data management with a centralized data layer.
- **Automatic Code Splitting** - Builds ultra performance into every page.
- **Plugin ecosystem** - Find a plugin for any job.

## What is the Jamstack?

**Gridsome is a Jamstack framework**. Jamstack lets you build fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.

## How it works

Gridsome **generates static html** that hydrates into a **Vue SPA** once loaded in the browser. This means you can build both **static websites** & **dynamic apps** with Gridsome.

Gridsome builds one `.html` file and one `.json` file for every page. After first page load it only uses the `.json` files to prefetch and load data for the next pages. It also builds a `.js` bundle for each page that needs it (code splitting).

It uses [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for SPA routing, and [vue-meta](https://vue-meta.nuxtjs.org/) for managing `<head>`.

Gridsome adds a `57kB min gzip` JS bundle size by default.(vue.js, vue-router, vue-meta and some for image lazy loading).

## Prerequisites

You should have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and how to use the [Terminal](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/using-the-terminal/). Knowing how [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) works is a plus, but not required. Gridsome is a great way to learn it.

Gridsome requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v8.3+) and recommends [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

## How to install

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool

- Using **YARN:** `yarn global add @gridsome/cli`
- Using **NPM:** `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project </li>
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### 3. Next steps

1. Create `.vue` components in the `src/pages` directory to create page routes.
2. Use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `/dist` folder

## Alternatives

- **[VuePress.](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)** Another static site generator for Vue.js. It uses local markdown files for content and is perfect for documentation sites. It is possible to build anything in VuePress and Markdown (Like a blog f.ex).

- **[Nuxt.](https://nuxtjs.org/)** A Universal Vue.js Framework for server-side rendered (SSR) apps and websites. It also has a static site generator feature, but the main focus is SSR.

- **[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)** Gridsome is highly inspired by Gatsby.js (React.js based), which collects data sources and generates a static site from it. Gridsome is an alternative for Gatsby.js.
