## Deploying your Gridsome Website to Deploy Now

Push your code to GitHub, sign in into your [Deploy Now](https://ionos.space/) account, click on `Add new project` and select your repo. Deploy Now automatically detects all build settings for Gridsome. Alternatively, it's possible to modify these settings. Once deployed, you will get a preview URL to see your Gridsome site live.

Choosing your custom domain is just one click further.
