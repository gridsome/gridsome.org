# Deployment

To deploy a Gridsome site you need a **static web host**.

## Git-based deploying

The best practice when working with Gridsome sites is to have your project hosted on a Git-service like GitHub and connect a deploy service that builds your site from a selected repository.

These services are great for Git-based deploying:

- [Netlify](/docs/deploy-to-netlify/)

- [AWS Amplify](/docs/deploy-to-amplify/)

- [Vercel](/docs/deploy-to-vercel/)

- [GitLab Pages](/docs/deploy-to-gitlab/)

- [GitHub Pages](/docs/deploy-to-github/)

- [Surge.sh](/docs/deploy-to-surge-sh/)

- [Azure Static Web Apps](/docs/deploy-to-az-static-web-app/)

## Deploy from terminal

Many services let you deploy your static Gridsome site from the terminal. Here are some:

- [Amazon S3](/docs/deploy-to-amazon-s3/)

- [Vercel](/docs/deploy-to-vercel/)

- [Surge.sh](/docs/deploy-to-surge-sh/)

## FTP deploying

To host your site on traditional hosting via FTP you need to manually build your project from the terminal.

- Run `gridsome build` in your project folder.
- This will generate a `dist` folder where your generated site is located.
- Upload the content of this folder to any FTP to get started.

## Drag & drop deploying

**Netlify Drop** lets you deploy a website with simply drag & drop.

- Run `gridsome build` in your project folder.
- This will generate a `dist` folder where your generated site is located.
- Visit [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) and drop the `dist` folder there.
