# Images

> Gridsome has a built-in `<g-image>` component that outputs an optimized progressive image. It also resizes and crops in real-time when developing. There is no fake resizing with CSS.

`<g-image>` compresses and lazy-loads images automatically. The images will be resized down to 480, 1024, 1920 and 2560 pixels by default. A blurred version is displayed while the image is being loaded and a fallback `img` tag for browsers without JavaScript enabled is also generated.

> Only local, relative image paths will be compressed by Gridsome.

## Usage in Vue templates

A `<g-image>` component is available in all your Vue templates and can be used to compress local images. The `src` attribute and options like `width`, `height` and `quality` must be static values because they are compiled into an object which contains URLs and other information that will be rendered into an `img` tag.

```html
<g-image src="./image.png" width="500"/>
```

## Usage via GraphQL
Local image paths from sources can also be compressed. Options like `width`, `height` and `quality` must be set in the query. The field can be passed to `g-image` as the `src` attribute.

```html
<template>
  <Layout>
    <g-image :src="$page.post.image" />
  </Layout>
</template>

<page-query>
query BlogPost ($path: String!) {
  post: blogPost (path: $path) {
    image (width: 720, height: 200, quality: 90)
  }
}
</page-query>
```

## Usage in Markdown
The [gridsome-transformer-remark](/plugins/transformer-remark) transformer plugin automatically converts normal Markdown images to `g-image` compatible markup.

```md
![Alternative text](./image.jpg)
```

## Image cropping
Crop the image by settings both `width` and `height` attributes. The image will be cropped to cover both dimensions by default. Change how to crop with the [`fit`](/docs/images#fit-options) attribute.

```html
<g-image src="./image.png" width="500" height="500" fit="contain"/>
```

## Options

|Property  |Default| |
|----------|-------|-|
|src       |*required*|Relative path to image file
|width     |          |Resize image to specified width in pixels
|height    |          |Crop & resize image to specified height in pixels
|alt       |          |Alternate text for the image
|fit 			 |`"cover"` |How to crop images. See properties below.
|background|          |Background color for 'contain'
|immediate |`false`   |Set to `true` to disable lazy-loading
|blur      |`40`      	|How much in px to blur the image placeholder
|quality   |`75`      |The quality of the image. (`0` - `100`).

### Fit options

|||
|-|-|
|cover    |Crop to cover both provided dimensions (default).
|contain  |Embed within both provided dimensions.
|fill     |Ignore the aspect ratio of the input and stretch to both provided dimensions.
|inside   |Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to both those specified.
|outside  |Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as small as possible while ensuring its dimensions are greater than or equal to both those specified.
