# Directory structure

A basic Gridsome project would be structured like this:

```text
.
├── package.json
├── gridsome.config.js
├── gridsome.server.js
├── static/
└── src/
    ├── main.js
    ├── index.html
    ├── App.vue
    ├── layouts/
    │   └── Default.vue
    ├── pages/
    │   ├── Index.vue
    │   └── Blog.vue
    └── templates/
        └── BlogPost.vue
```

## The root directory

### package.json

Contains information about which plugins are installed in your project.

### gridsome.config.js

This file contains configuration and options for installed plugins.

[Read more about project config](/docs/config/)

### gridsome.server.js

This file is optional and is used to hook into various parts of the Gridsome server. The file must export a function which will have access to the API.

[Read more about the Server API](/docs/server-api/)

## The `/src` directory

### Main.js

Import global styles and scripts here. The file also has an export function that has access to the **Client API**. This file is the place to install Vue plugins, register components and directives, etc.

[Read more about using the Client API in main.js](/docs/client-api/)

### Layouts directory

Create components in this directory if you want to share one or more
layouts for your pages or templates.

[Read more about layouts](/docs/layouts/)

### Pages directory

All components in this directory become the pages for your website.
Each page will get its path based on the location of its `.vue` file.
`src/pages/Index.vue` will become the homepage for your website,
while `src/pages/AboutUs.vue` will be `example.com/about-us`.

[Read more about pages](/docs/pages/)

### Templates directory

If you are importing an external data source, like posts from a
WordPress blog, into your project then each post would look for a
component in this directory for its template. The name of the
component file must match the node type in your GraphQL schema.

[Read more about templates](/docs/templates/)

### Custom index.html

Occasionally you will need to override the base HTML template that Gridsome uses to generate your pages from. Gridsome makes this really easy. All you have to do is create a new `index.html` file in your `src` directory.

[Read more about overriding index.html](/docs/overriding-index/)

### Custom App.vue

The `App.vue` file is the main component that wraps all your pages and templates. You can override the default file by having your own `App.vue` file in your `src` directory. Overriding the default is useful if you want to have a layout that is shared across all your pages.

[Read more about overriding App.vue](/docs/overriding-app/)

## The `/static` directory

Files in this directory will be copied directly to `dist` during build. For example, **/static/robots.txt** will be located at https://yoursite.com/robots.txt

## Aliases

In Gridsome you can use the aliases `~` or `@` to link to files inside the `/src` folder. For example, you can import a Vue component by using `import Card from '~/components/Card'`

## Recommendation

### Assets

Global styles, images, fonts and icons are usually added to a `src/assets` directory.

### Shared or global components

Components that you want to use in several pages or templates can be stored
in a `src/components` directory.

### Data files

Data files like `.json` or `.yaml` that you want to import into your components, can be stored in a `src/data` directory.
