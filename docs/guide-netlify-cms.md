# Gridsome Netlify CMS Guide

## Prerequisites

We assume you've worked with `@gridsome/source-filesystem` and `@gridsome/transformer-remark` before this guide.

Gridsome requires **Node.js** and recommends **Yarn**. [How to setup](https://gridsome.org/docs/prerequisites)

## 1. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local development server

## 2. Install the required dependencies

Gridsome already provides you a set of [plugins](https://gridsome.org/plugins) to get you started.

1. `yarn add netlify-cms gridsome-plugin-netlify-cms @gridsome/source-filesystem @gridsome/transformer-remark` to install the required dependencies

## 3. Configuration

Alright, the plugins are installed, it's now time to setup the right configuration. Open the `gridsome.config.js` file and make sure it looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteName: 'Gridsome',
  transformers: {
    remark: {
      externalLinksTarget: '_blank',
      externalLinksRel: ['nofollow', 'noopener', 'noreferrer'],
      anchorClassName: 'icon icon-link',
      plugins: [
        // ...global plugins
      ]
    }
  },

  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@gridsome/source-filesystem',
      options: {
        path: 'posts/**/*.md',
        typeName: 'Post',
        remark: {
          plugins: [
            // ...local plugins
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      use: `gridsome-plugin-netlify-cms`,
      options: {
        publicPath: `/admin`
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Please read [gridsome-plugin-netlify-cms](https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-netlify-cms), [transformer-remark](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/transformer-remark) for more information about the configurations.

## 4. Netlify CMS setup

It's time to add the CMS!

1. Create an `admin` directory inside the `src`
2. Create an `uploads` directory inside the root of your project
3. Add `index.html`, `index.js` and a `config.yml` file to your `admin` directory

Your `index.html` should look like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Netlify CMS</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="index.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Your `index.js` should look like this:

```js
import CMS from "netlify-cms"
```

Your `config.yml` should look like this:

```yml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: your_name/repo_name

media_folder: "static/uploads"
public_folder: "/uploads"

collections:
  - name: "posts"
    label: "Posts"
    folder: "posts"
    create: true
    slug: "{{slug}}"
    fields:
      - {label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string"}
      - {label: "Excerpt", name: "excerpt", widget: "string"}
      - {label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "date"}
      - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
```

## 5. Netlify CMS authentication with GitHub

Before we can start adding posts we'll have to give Netlify access to our Github, this part is **crucial**, please follow the steps closely. More info can be read [here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/);

Part 1, GitHub:

1. Open [this](https://github.com/settings/developers) link
2. Click on "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in all the fields according to your website and use `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done` as Authorization callback URL

Part 2, Netlify:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard and click on your project
2. Navigate to Settings > Access control > OAuth
3. Under Authentication Providers, click Install Provider
4. Select GitHub and enter the Client ID and Client Secret, then save ([0Auth Docs - How do I find my GitHub client ID and secret?](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/github#3-get-your-github-app-s-client-id-and-client-secret))

## Start coding

Your basic blog scaffold is done now, you can now query data from the GraphQL server just like you're working with the filesystem. For more info read [querying data](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data).
