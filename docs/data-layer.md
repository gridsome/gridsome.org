# The GraphQL data layer

![Import data](./images/import-data.png)

**The GraphQL data layer is a tool available in development mode**. This is where all of the data imported into a Gridsome project is temporarily stored. Think of it as a local database that helps you work faster and better with your data.

Data coming from the GraphQL data layer is generated into **static content**. There is no real-time connection between the data layer and the source the data is imported from. This means you need to re-generate the website to get the latest data updates.

If you need dynamic data you should use [client-side data](/docs/client-side-data/).

ðŸ’¡ **Pages and Site metadata are added to the data layer by default.**

## The GraphQL explorer

Every Gridsome project has a **GraphQL explorer (Playground)** that can be used to explore and test queries when in development mode. Here you also get a list of all available GraphQL collections. This can usually be opened by going to `http://localhost:8080/___explore`.
