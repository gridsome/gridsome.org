Using Markdown for content is great. It let you have all your content and code in the same repository. With **vue-remark** you can now import Vue Components and other Markdown files (!!) inside your Markdown files. This is perfect for adding extra functionality to your Markdown content. You can also use **vue-remark** to build all your pages in `src/pages` directory. You even get **code-splitting** at build time for all Markdown pages.


## How to use

1. Install `@gridsome/vue-remark` with Yarn or NPM to your Gridsome project.
2. Add the following code to `gridsome.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@gridsome/vue-remark',
      options: {
        typeName: 'Doc', // GraphQL type name (required)
        baseDir: './content/docs', // Where files are located (required)
        pathPrefix: '/docs', // Route prefix
        layout: './src/layouts/Doc.vue', // What layout to use
        remark: {
          // optional remark options and plugins
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

ðŸ’¥ **@gridsome/vue-remark** is designed to work as a drop-in replacement for **@gridsome/source-filesystem**. If you're already using **filesystem-source** you can change out the **use** and add **layout** and **pathPrefix** options.

In this example any `.md` file in `./content/docs` will be a page.

- `/content/docs/index.md` will be  **/docs**
- `/content/docs/how-to-use.md` will be **/docs/how-to-use**
- `/content/docs/folder/index.md` will be **/docs/folder**

## Example Markdown file

```jsx
---
title: A cool title
excerpt: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text.
---
// Import Vue components
import Youtube from '~/components/Youtube.vue'

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}
> {{ $frontmatter.excerpt }}

Add **Markdown content** here...

<Youtube id="xyxyxy" />

Some more Markdown content here.
```

> All **front-matter** fields are available in `$frontmatter` and in the **GraphQL data layer** if you want to query data from other pages.


### Use Markdown files as components.

Use other `.md` files as Vue Components!

```jsx
---
title: A cool title
excerpt: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text.
---
import IntroBox from '~/components/IntroBox.md'

<IntroBox :text="$frontmatter.excerpt" />
```


### Use any components that are registered globally.

Register components globally in `src/main.js` if you don't want to import them for every page.
Learn how to [make a component global](/docs/components#make-a-component-global).


```jsx
---
title: A cool title
---
<GlobalComponent>
  Global component
</GlobalComponent>
```

### Use all the power of Vue Components in Markdown

You can add GraphQL queries, script and style tags.

```jsx
---
title: A cool title
---

Some _markdown_ content...

<style lang="scss">
.some-style {
  border: red;
}
</style>

<page-query>
  ...
</page-query>

<script>
  ...
</script>
```

## What about MDX for Vue?
MDX will have Vue.js support (https://mdxjs.com/guides/vue), but the problem is that it's still JSX. Under the hood **MDX** converts `.mdx` files into `JSX`, but **vue-remark**  simply converts `.md` files into `.vue` files. That's better and more efficient for Vue projects. 

The MDX project is still great, so Gridsome will probably have an MDX plugin at some point also.


## Gotchas...
**Vue-remark** uses runs all files trough Webpack to render Vue Components. This will slow the build process down compared to for example **filesystem-source**. It's not recommended to use **vue-remark** if you plan to have thousands of blog posts.  **vue-remark** is perfect for documentation, design systems, portfolios, and smaller blogs.
