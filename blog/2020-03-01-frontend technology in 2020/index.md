# 2018 I tried the following:

-   Create a `vue-cli-plugin` with `nedb` and `lowdb` integration
-   Publish my first `npm` package
-   Do the `jest` test and apply the `TDD`
-   Apply `Orm` with `vuex`
-   Try `graphql` with `prisma`
-   Build a `electron` program
-   Do basic `CI` and publish `releases` in `github`
-   Create `template` with `hygen` for production ready approach
-   Using `typescript` as main programming language
-   Borrow beautiful themes with `vuetify`
-   Writing blogs with `gatsby` and `gridsome`
-   Try static site generator with `netlify`
-   Try services like `now` and `surge`

Even through there are many challenges and problems, I feel I dive deeper in the
fronten development ecosystem with self-learning and knowledge-sharing.

# Todos in 2019:

So I am asking myself the following questions. You don&rsquo;t want to be a Junior Web
Developer anymore You want to become a Senior Developer one day and earn a
higher salary You want to learn best practices and build scalable applications
professionally You know HTML, CSS and Javascript but want to expand your skills
and do more You want to start your own business or become a freelancer You want
to learn advanced industry skills that are necessary in 2018 to get hired as a
web developer You want one course to teach you everything in one place from a
Senior Developer that works in the industry

-   Create a `vscode` extension
-   Create a `chrome` extension
-   Create a `vuex` plugin
