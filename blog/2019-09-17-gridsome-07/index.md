## Vue Remark plugin

With Gridsome 0.7 follows a new plugin called [@gridsome/vue-remark](/plugins/@gridsome/vue-remark). It lets you add Vue Components to Markdown files. This is perfect for Documentation, Design Systems, or portfolio websites. It's an Vue / Gridsome alternative to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Here is a quick overview of how it works:

1) Install the plugin and add configs:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@gridsome/vue-remark',
      options: {
        typeName: 'Documentation', // Required
        baseDir: './content/docs', // Where .md files are located
        pathPrefix: '/docs', // Add route prefix. Optional
        template: './src/templates/Documentation.vue' // Optional
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
In this example `/content/docs/index.md` will be `website.com/docs/`,
and `/content/docs/install-guide.md` will be `website.com/docs/install-guide/`.

By default it takes any **.md** files in `baseDir` folder and uses them for file-based routing like [Pages](/docs/pages/) works. You can override this by using a `route` config.

2) Setup a template and include the `<VueRemarkContent />` component:

```html
<template>
  <Layout>
    <h1>{{ $page.documentation.title }}</h1>
    <p class="intro">{{ $page.documentation.excerpt }}</p>
    <VueRemarkContent />
  </Layout>
</template>

<!-- Front-matter fields can be queried from GraphQL layer -->
<page-query>
query ($id: ID!) {
  documentation(id: $id) {
    title
    excerpt
  }
}
</page-query>
```

3) Import and use Vue components in Markdown:

```jsx
---
title: A cool title
excerpt: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text.
---
// Import any Vue Component. Even other .md files!
import YouTube from '~/components/YouTube.vue'
import AboutUs from '~/sections/AboutUs.md'

// Import any JSON if you need data.
import data from '~/data/youtube.json'

// Use front-matter fields anywhere.
# {{ $frontmatter.title }}
> {{ $frontmatter.excerpt }}

// Use your imported Vue Components.
<YouTube :id="data.id" />
<AboutUs />

Isn't it great? ðŸ¥³

```

You can use `<page-query>` & `<style>` blocks inside the Markdown files too!

## New Schema API

Gridsome generates the GraphQL schema for metadata and collections based on the data which is discovered on startup. That's great for simple projects but will often lead to errors with, for example missing fields because content has been removed in an external source. This API lets you define your own schema types to have persisted fields.

```js
api.loadSource(({ addSchemaTypes }) => {
  addSchemaTypes(`
    type Post implements Node {
      title: String
    }
  `)
})
```

ðŸ™Œ This will fix problems for **data sources** where the data fields can change.

For example, [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) (A Headless CMS) has created a source plugin ([gridsome-source-sanity](/plugins/gridsome-source-sanity)) that uses the Schema API to make sure Gridsome know what fields that are being used in Sanity.io.

Read more about the [Schema API](/docs/schema-api/)

## New template configuration

Previously, each collection has been given a route in order to assign it to a template with the same name inside the `src/templates` directory. Routes were spread across many plugin options and some also hidden within plugins. **The new `templates` config tries to collect all collection routes in a single property in `gridsome.config.js`.**

> This gives better overview of all template routes, and you can also have multiple templates and routes for one collection. For example `/product/:slug` + `/product/:slug/reviews`.

To create a route for a [collection](/docs/collections/) you simply add `CollectionName: '/any/route/:title'` to the new [templates](/docs/templates/) config. A Vue component in `src/templates` with the same name as the collection will be used as template by default. Here are some examples:

```js
// gridsome.config.js
module.exports = {
  templates: {
    // These will look for and use src/templates/{name}.vue
    Post: '/blog/:year/:month/:slug',
    Author: '/author/:name',

    // Templates for source plugins must also be configured here
    WordPressPost: '/blog/:year/:month/:day/:slug',
    WordPressTag: '/tag/:slug',

    // Collections can have multiple templates
    Product: [
      {
        path: '/product/:slug',
        component: './src/templates/Product.vue'
      },
      {
        path: '/product/:slug/reviews',
        component: './src/templates/ProductReviews.vue'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**This means:**
- [Source plugins](/plugins) & the [Data store API](/docs/data-store-api/) are only responsible for creating [Collections](/docs/collections/).
- The new [Templates](/docs/templates/) config are used to setup **templates and routes** for collections.

## Dynamic routing

Dynamic routing is perfect to use if you need routes for, for example, user accounts or need to fetch data from an external source on client-side. (Data that will not be generated).

#### File-based dynamic routes

Dynamic pages are used for client-side routing. Route parameters can be placed in file and directory names by wrapping the name in square brackets. For example:

- `src/pages/user/[id].vue` becomes `/user/:id`.
- `src/pages/user/[id]/settings.vue` becomes `/user/:id/settings`.

At build time, this will generate `user/_id.html` and `user/_id/settings.html` and you must have rewrite rules to make them work properly on a static web host.

#### Programmatic dynamic routes

Create pages with dynamic routes programmatically for more advanced paths. Dynamic parameters are specified by having a `:` in front of a segment. And each parameter can have a custom regular expression to match only digits or certain values.

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.createPages(({ createPage }) => {
    createPage({
      path: '/user/:id(\\d+)',
      component: './src/templates/User.vue'
    })
  })
}
```

## Custom App.vue

**App.vue** is the file that wraps your whole website or app. Gridsome usually adds a `App.vue` automatic in the background. This can now be overridden by having your own `App.vue` file in your `src` directory. Overriding `App.vue` is useful if you want to have a **layout that is shared across all your pages.** Or if you want to have a `<transition>` component around the `<router-view>`.

Here is an example:

```html
<!-- src/App.vue -->
<template>
  <MainLayout>
    <transition>
      <router-view />
    </transition>
  </MainLayout>
</template>

<script>
import MainLayout from '~/layouts/Main.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    MainLayout
  }
}
</script>
```

## Deprecation notices

Deprecated methods and options will now be listed in the terminal with path to location and sometimes with an URL to documentation.

![Deprecated Messages](./deprecated-messages.png)

## Shareable Network URL

A network URL will now be visible in the terminal. It can be used to test the site on other devices in the same network with hot-reloading etc. This URL will only be active when using the default host, which is `0.0.0.0`, on private networks.

![Shareable url](./shareable-url.png)

## Breaking changes

- The `fields` property for nodes will not be moved to root automatically anymore. Add custom node fields as root properties instead. [Read more](/docs/data-store-api/#collectionaddnodeoptions)

## Other changes

#### Trailing slashes for pages and routes

Routes for pages in `./src/pages` and all templates will include a trailing slash by default. This can be disabled with the [`permalinks`](/docs/config/#permalinkstrailingslash) config.

**You should have a trailing slash in every static `<g-link>` path if you are hosting the site on Netlify or Vercel etc. to avoid redirects.** For example:

```html
<g-link to="/about-us/">About us</g-link>
```

#### Renamed methods and GraphQL fields

There are some methods and GraphQL fields that have been renamed. Using the old names will not break your site, but will show deprecation notices in the terminal:

- Use `addMetadata()` instead of `addMetaData()`.
- Use `addCollection()` instead of `addContentType()`.
- Use `metadata` instead of `metaData` in the GraphQL schema and project config.

#### Deprecated collection methods

The new [Schema API](/docs/schema-api/) is deprecating previous methods for customizing the schema:

- Use `addSchemaResolvers()` instead of `collection.addSchemaField()`.
- `addSchemaTypes()` can be instead of `collection.addReference()`. It's not deprecated yet, but it will be once we find an easier way to define relations.

#### New type for the `$id` variable

The `$id` variable in `<page-query>` for nodes has previously been a `String` type. Even though the `id` field in the schema was of type `ID`. But the `$id` input variable must also be a `ID` type from now on. Gridsome will fix the type for you automatically and show a deprecation notice until you have updated the query.

ðŸ™Œ You will probably get many deprecated messages on your current Gridsome project, but we think these changes are a right direction as we're getting close to a 1.0 version.
