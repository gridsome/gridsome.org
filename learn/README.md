Welcome to the Gridsome tutorial. In this tutorial, we're going to install the **default Gridsome starter** and add features to it that will cover the basics of Gridsome.

- **Vue.js for templating** - Unlimited layout possibilities
- **Static pages** - Core functionality of Gridsome is to build static pages
- **The** **GraphQL data layer** - Easy to query content you need from any added data source
